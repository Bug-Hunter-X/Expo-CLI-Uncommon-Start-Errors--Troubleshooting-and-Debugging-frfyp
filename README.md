# Expo CLI Uncommon Start Errors: Debugging Guide

This repository demonstrates a common yet often difficult-to-diagnose error encountered when starting an Expo project using the `expo start` command. The error message is usually vague, hindering straightforward debugging.

## Problem

Expo's `expo start` command unexpectedly fails without a detailed error message.  This can stem from various sources: configuration problems, unmet dependencies, or issues with native modules.

## Solution

The solution focuses on systematic debugging approaches:

1. **Verify `app.json`/`expo.json` Configuration:** Check for typos, incorrect paths to assets or modules, and ensure the configuration adheres to Expo's documentation.
2. **Dependency Check:** Carefully examine your `package.json`. Ensure all dependencies are compatible and correctly installed. Check for conflicting versions.
3. **Native Modules:** If using native modules, double-check their setup and compatibility with your Expo SDK version.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** Sometimes, cached files interfere. Delete your `node_modules` folder, run `npm install` or `yarn install`, and restart Expo.
5. **Check Logs:** Explore Expo's logs for more detailed error messages, which might be hidden in the terminal output.  Pay close attention to warnings.
6. **Expo Diagnostics:** Run Expo's diagnostic tools if available to identify and resolve issues automatically.
7. **Simplify:** Create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem. This helps narrow down the source of the error.
