This error typically occurs when using Expo's `expo start` command and encountering a problem with your project's configuration or dependencies.  The error message itself isn't always descriptive, often just indicating a general failure during the build or start process.  The underlying cause can be subtle and might involve incorrect package versions, missing native modules, or configuration inconsistencies between your `app.json` or `expo.json` and your project's structure. For example, an incorrect path to an asset or a dependency conflict.
